# ATM_MANAGEMENT_SYSTEM
The ATM Management System is a console-based application developed using Python Object Oriented Programming (OOPS) concepts.
This project simulates the basic working of an ATM such as balance enquiry, deposit, withdrawal, and exit operations.

👉 Ee project main goal: OOPS concepts ni real-time example tho understand cheyyadam.

🎯 Objectives
